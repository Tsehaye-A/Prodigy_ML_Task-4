# Hand Gesture Recognition Model  
Prodigy InfoTech – Machine Learning Internship (Task 4)

This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.  
The objective was to design and implement a Hand Gesture Recognition Model capable of accurately identifying and classifying different hand gestures from image and video data.

The model integrates computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable gesture-based human-computer interaction, with potential applications in sign language recognition, gaming, and smart control systems.
